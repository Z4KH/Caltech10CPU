This folder includes the implementation of the Caltech10 CPU as a command line interface using the simCaltech10 application. 
It also includes an example file(gcdEuclidCaltech10), which can be run in the simulator. 
The example file computes the greatest common divisor of two integers(<256) stored in 0x00 and 0x01 in memory and outputs it to the accumulator.
